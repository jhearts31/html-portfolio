  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am <b>John Venheart T. Alejo</b> from the Philippines. I was college instructor teaching computer science and information technlogy in the university in our province. 
    Currently I am web developer in 3wCorners. I choose to enroll The Complete 2023 Web Development to update my arsenal in web development and learn new things like react.</p>
