    <h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
        <p>
            Hunter x Hunter begins with Gon Freecss, as he sets out on a journey to become a Hunter. He’s your typical savior-figure protagonist, but fortunately he keeps the annoying, repetitive mantras to himself. His determination to see the best in people becomes a marvel of the series, and his dedication to others drives the plot. He makes friends with a young boy from a family of assassins, and their polarized dynamic creates a connection that makes the series inspiring. The compelling relationship between these two boys demands emotional investment from you. Togashi emphasizes their youth and inexperience by pitting them against much older, more experienced villains, and introduces powerful mentors that help them evolve. He’s meticulous about tailoring his characters’ abilities to their personality, but everyone draws their strength from resolve. The feats of pure determination you’ll witness in this anime will change you.

    <h3>DRAGON BALL Z</h3>
        <p>
            In every practical sense, Akira Toriyama’s status as one of anime’s greatest creators was all but secured with Dragon Ball. Loosely inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, the manga and subsequent anime series of Son Goku’s misadventures to collect all seven of the mythical dragon balls inspired whole generations of manga artists and animators in Japan. The original series was a classic, but it was Dragon Ball Z that marked the series’ transition from a national treasure into a worldwide phenomenon. With hyper-kinetic violence, flashy energy attacks, dizzying spectacles of mass destruction, and tense moments of serial escalation, Dragon Ball Z is a singularly important installment in the canon of martial arts action anime and an enduring entry point for newcomers to the medium to this day. —Toussaint Egan

    <h3>Lupin III</h3>
        <p>
            Lupin III is anime’s most iconic gentleman thief—a rakish criminal genius who first showed up in manga runs from the late ’60s while Sean Connery was defining James Bond. Lupin’s approach is similar: He fights, he fucks, he steals things, and he’s the grandson of the OG gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin. Lupin III’s adventures now span a half-century franchise, but what’s more notable is how many anime series claim the character, originally created as contract work, as an influence. Cowboy Bebop’s Spike Spiegel flat-out wouldn’t exist without Lupin’s character as a model

    <h3>Shaman King</h3>
        <p>
            Shaman King follows the misadventures of Yoh Asakura, a laid-back and carefree young boy who possesses the ability to communicate with spirits. Yoh later decides to take on a challenging task – to become the next Shaman King. In order to do this, he must train and go on a perilous journey to compete in the Shaman Fight and prove himself to be the best. Yoh’s growth as a powerful shaman and an endearing character is the focus of the series, which blends mysticism with a healthy dose of action. For those new to anime or seeking an exhilarating blend of supernatural powers and personal growth, Shaman King is predictable for seasoned anime fans, but likely to be exciting for newcomers.

    <h3>Digimon: Digital Monsters</h3>
        <p>
            The anime chronicles how these children bond and work with the Digimon to save both their worlds from evil forces that seek to destroy them. As the series progresses, it achieves a surprising level of emotional depth that makes it more about the friendships they forge instead of just the action-packed battles (which are fantastic, too). With such a rich world and a vibrant franchise to back it, Digimon is an excellent starting point and one of the best anime series to watch for complete beginners.
        </p>
    <h3>Inuyasha</h3>
        <p>
            Kagome Higurashi is a typical modern-day schoolgirl whose life is forever changed when she is transported back in time to feudal Japan. There, she meets Inuyasha, a half-demon with a penchant for attracting dangerous and violent situations. The duo soon goes on a quest to retrieve the shards of the powerful Shikon Jewel, which has the power to grant someone anything their heart desires.
        </p>
    <h3>Pokémon</h3>
        <p>
            Easily among the top anime to watch for beginners, Pokémon is a show (and franchise) that needs no introduction. The long-running series introduced fans to the adventurous Ash Ketchum, who goes on a challenging journey to become a Pokémon Master. Of course, he takes along the powerful yet adorable Pikachu, and the duo competes in increasingly difficult battles.
        </p>
    <h3>Yu Yu Hakusho</h3>
        <p>
            Yu Yu Hakusho revolves around the experiences of teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, whose life soon changes when he’s tasked with becoming a “Spirit Detective.” Before long, he’s facing off against terrifying ghosts, powerful demons, and other supernatural enemies. He also brings along loyal friends Kurama, Hiei, and Kuwabara.
        </p>
    <h3>Naruto: Shippuden</h3>
        <p>
            Naruto sees the hero’s journey to its fullest extent, with many long-time fans voicing how growing up alongside this show has shaped who they are. Beyond its sentimentality, the show also boasts some of the most iconic hand-combat animation in anime history. The series is more easy-going and perfect as a starter to anime.
        </p>
    <h3>One Piece</h3>
        <p>
            The series that introduced the fan-favorite Straw Hats (led by the massively popular Luffy), One Piece follows the rowdy group as they sail across the ocean in search of the ultimate titular treasure. In the process, they face increasingly powerful enemies, but also make some temporary alliances and life-long friends.
